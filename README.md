# MYREADS APP
DISCLAIMER: 
ALOT OF THE IDEA AND CODEBASE WAS GOTTEN FROM JAMES PRIEST AND IT WASN'T SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW AS AN UDACITY PROJECT
THIS IS AN IMPLEMENTATION USING THE ```CREATE-APP LODASH-DEBOUNCE```
This is the first Project for the Udacity React Nano-degree Program
The idea is to build an app based on the concepts learned that allows you to move books from one category of choice to another
Th Categories currently are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

It also contains a search functionality which can be seen using the floating button on the page 
or visiting the url:
- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)/search

## Installation

To install the app, 
-clone the repo from the Web UI or from your terminal using 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nseetim/reactnd_project_my-reads_app.git`
```
-switch directory to the directory of the cloned repo

```bash
$ cd your_working_directory/reactnd_project_my-reads_app.git`
```
-install dependencies using npm or yarn

```bash
$ npm install
```
or
```bash
$ yarm install
```
-start the app using npm or yarm

```bash
$ npm start
```
or
```bash
$ yarn start
```

You should be automatically redirected to the page once the server is up and running or you could visit 
- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  on your browser
